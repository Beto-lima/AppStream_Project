AWS AppStream Terraform Automation
Automate your AWS AppStream fleet and stack provisioning with Terraform â€” no manual clicking, no guesswork, 100% codified infrastructure.

Why This Project Matters
Managing AWS AppStream setups by hand? Painful, slow, error-prone. This project flips the script:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Define AppStream fleets, stacks, IAM roles, and associations with clean Terraform modules.

Production-Grade Automation: Spin up or tear down your AppStream environment instantly, with zero human errors.

CI/CD Integration Ready: Plug into GitHub Actions for peer-reviewed, safe infrastructure changes.

Cost & Time Efficient: Automatically manage resources to avoid overspending and wasted time.

Security Focused: Implements least privilege IAM roles and best-practice security policies.

Real-World Impact
Faster Delivery: Reduce environment setup from hours/days to minutes.

Scalability & Flexibility: Easily adapt fleet size to user demand or project phase.

Reliable Deployments: Consistent infra across dev, staging, and production.

Business Value: Cut operational overhead, reduce security risks, speed up app delivery.

How to Use
Customize variables in terraform.tfvars.
